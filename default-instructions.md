Welcome to our Image Annotation Tool.

Your task is to accurately draw rectangles around people and balls in each image.

## Quick Instructions
1. Draw a box accurately around a person (covering every part you can see)
2. Draw a box accurately around a ball (covering every part you can see)
2. Hit 'd' to delete a box
3. Adjust the box to keep it accurate


For example:

## Keyboard Shortcuts
- `d` or 'delete' to delete selected rectangle

## Detailed Instructions
1. We need you to draw an accurate box around each person and ball you see in the video
2. **We recommend you start drawing the persons in the back before drawing the persons in the front**
3. A person must be clearly distinguishable, not part of a crowd on the background.
4. More than half of a person or a ball must be visible to be relevant.
5. If you can't see the person or the ball in the image **Clearly** then don't draw any rectangles
6. If you can **Clearly** see only half body parts of the person then do not draw a rectangles on it

## How accurate do you need to be?
We require a tight rectangle covering all of the person and ball visible in that image.
