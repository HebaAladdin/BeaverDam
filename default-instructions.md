Welcome to our Image Annotation Tool.

Your task is to accurately draw rectangles around people and balls in each image. We need this so that we can train a computer to detect people's and ball's presence for a soccer training application.

## Quick Instructions
1. Draw a box accurately around a person (covering every part you can see)
2. Draw a box accurately around a ball (covering every part you can see)
2. Hit 'd' to delete a box
3. Adjust the box to keep it accurate


For example:

## Keyboard Shortcuts
- `d` or 'delete' to delete selected rectangle

## Detailed Instructions
1. We need you to draw an accurate box around each person and ball you see in the video
2. We recommend you start drawing the persons in the back before drawing the persons in the front 
3. If you can't see the person or the ball in the image **Clearly** then don't draw any rectangles
5. If you can **Clearly** see only half body parts of the person the draw a rectangle on it 

## How accurate do you need to be?
We require a tight rectangle covering all of the person and ball visible in that image.
