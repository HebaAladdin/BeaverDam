Welcome to our Image Annotation Tool.

Your task is to accurately draw rectangles around people and balls in each image. We need this so that we can train a computer to detect people's and ball's presence for a soccer training application.

## Quick Instructions
1. Draw a box accurately around a person (covering every part you can see)
2. Draw a box accurately around a ball (covering every part you can see)
2. Hit 'd' to delete a frame
3. Adjust the box to keep it accurate


For example:
### Good:

## Keyboard Shortcuts
- `d` or 'delete' to delete selected rectangle

## Detailed Instructions
1. We need you to draw an accurate box around each person and ball you see in the video
2. We recommend you draw the persons in the back before drawing the persons in the front 
3. If you can't see the person in the frame *clearly* then don't draw any rectangles
5. If you can *clearly* see only half body parts of the person the draw a rectangle on it 

## Bonus Payment
1. The time to complete one HIT will depend on the number of people in the frame and the amount of movement.
2. As such we will pay a bonus of $0.02c per accurate frame mapped.
3. Note if the person does not move at all or if the dotted rectangle is accurate, please do NOT create a rectangle in that frame. We will reject the HIT if you do this.

## How accurate do you need to be?
We require a tight rectangle covering all of the person visible in that video frame.
